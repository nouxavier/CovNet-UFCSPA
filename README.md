# CovNet-UFCSPA

## Abstract
The prompt and proper identifying COVID-19 in patients provides adequate screening, thus preventing the worsening of symptoms caused by the disease. This research proposes the CovNet-UFCSPA architecture comprising data from clinical images (X-ray) pre-processing and DML. A total of 24 235 images for model training, validation, and testing. Clipping techniques, GCE and CLAHE  in the pre-processing of the images. The architecture had a 99\% recall when used to classify x-rays from Brazilian patients at Hospital da Cl√≠nica de Porto Alegre of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (HCPA - UFRGS). Applying CLAHE and removing the X-ray region of interest improved the FN rate, decreasing the model classification results from 187 to 9. In addition, the architecture provided a tool that can be useful to health professionals with a score metric and the heat map of the tested images. For performance analysis, the architecture is compared to a Resnet50 V2 and an Inception V3; the results showed that the CovNet-UFCSPA architecture obtained the best FN and TP rates and recall.
